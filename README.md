# Taino-js
A relative framework based on vanilla js

Reason for the name:
Frameworks have tried to abstract away from core javascript far too much and from our point of view it is not necessary. 
We simple need to create "good relatives" to vanilla js, just the Taino.

Origin of the term:
Taino is a term referring to the indigenous peoples of the carribean. It's original meaning is "relatives" and "good people" and these are considered to be part of the Arawak natives of south america and the carribean.
