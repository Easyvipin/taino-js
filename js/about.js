            We've created a framework based on vanilla javascript.

            <h2>The reason for creating this:</h2>
            <p>
            Existing frameworks have tried to abstract away from core javascript far too much and from our point of view it is not necessary. 
            We simply need to create "good relatives" to vanilla js, just the Taino.

            <h2>Origin of the term:</h2>
            <p>
            Taino is a term referring to the indigenous peoples of the carribean. 
            It's original meaning is "relatives" and "good people" and these were considered to be part of the Arawak natives of south america and the carribean.
